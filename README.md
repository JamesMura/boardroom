#Board Room

Interactive story boarding for distributed teams.

Currently we use Board Room for reflection meetings, but it will soon be useful for:
* Story writing
* Story mapping
* General distributed story boarding

Board Room is build with [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).
